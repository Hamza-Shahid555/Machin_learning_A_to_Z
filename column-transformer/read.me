In machine learning, a ColumnTransformer is a powerful tool from the scikit-learn library designed to apply different data preprocessing steps to specific columns of a dataset.
This is particularly useful when dealing with heterogeneous data, where different types of features (e.g., numerical, categorical) require different transformations.
