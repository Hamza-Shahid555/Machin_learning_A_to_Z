# Regularized Linear Models

## 📌 Introduction

Regularized Linear Models extend traditional linear regression by adding a **penalty term** to the loss function. This helps prevent **overfitting**, improves **generalization**, and handles **multicollinearity** in datasets.

---

## 🔍 Why Regularization?

Linear regression may fail when:

* Too many features exist
* Features are highly correlated
* Model overfits training data

Regularization controls model complexity by shrinking coefficients.

## 📊 Types of Regularized Models

### Ridge Regression (L2)

* Penalizes squared coefficients
* Shrinks weights but keeps all features
* Good for multicollinearity

**Loss**

```
RSS + λ Σ w²
```

---

### Lasso Regression (L1)

* Penalizes absolute coefficients
* Can remove irrelevant features
* Produces sparse models

**Loss**

```
RSS + λ Σ |w|
```

---

### Elastic Net

* Combination of L1 and L2
* Handles correlated features better
* Balanced feature selection

**Loss**

```
RSS + λ₁ Σ |w| + λ₂ Σ w²
```

## 🆚 Model Comparison

| Model             | Regularization | Feature Selection | Multicollinearity |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Linear Regression | ❌ None         | ❌ No              | ❌ No              |
| Ridge             | ✅ L2           | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes             |
| Lasso             | ✅ L1           | ✅ Yes             | ⚠️ Limited        |
| Elastic Net       | ✅ L1 + L2      | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes             |

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
```

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet

model_ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
model_lasso = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
model_elastic = ElasticNet(alpha=0.1, l1_ratio=0.5)
```

## 📈 Applications

* Medical prediction systems
* Finance and risk modeling
* High-dimensional datasets
* Feature selection problems

---

## 📝 Key Takeaways

* Regularization reduces overfitting
* Ridge improves stability
* Lasso performs feature selection
* Elastic Net combines both benefits
