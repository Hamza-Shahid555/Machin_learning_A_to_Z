📈 Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to model non-linear relationships between input features and the target variable by introducing polynomial terms.

📌 What is Polynomial Regression?

Polynomial Regression extends Linear Regression by adding higher-degree powers of the input feature.

Although the curve is non-linear, the model remains linear in parameters, making it easy to train using standard regression techniques.
