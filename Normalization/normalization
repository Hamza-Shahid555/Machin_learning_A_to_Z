Normalization in data preprocessing / machine learning means scaling numerical data into a specific range (usually 0 to 1) without distorting the differences in the values.

🔹 Formal Definition:

Normalization is the process of transforming data values into a common scale so that they can be compared meaningfully.

🔹 Why we need it?

Different features may have very different scales (e.g., salary in lakhs vs. age in years).

Many ML algorithms (KNN, Neural Networks, Gradient Descent–based models) perform better and converge faster when data is normalized.

Prevents large-scale features from dominating small-scale features.

🔹 Common Normalization Techniques:

Min-Max Normalization (Rescaling)

Scales data into [0,1] range.

Mean becomes 0, standard deviation becomes 1.

Decimal Scaling
Moves the decimal point of values until they fall into a range like [-1, 1].

🔹 Example:

Original data: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100]

Min-Max Normalization (0–1 scale): [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]

Z-score Normalization: [-1.26, -0.63, 0, 0.63, 1.26]
