# 🎯 Classification Metrics

A robust, high-performance toolkit designed for evaluating classification machine learning models. This project provides a standardized approach to measuring model performance, going beyond simple accuracy to offer deep insights into precision, recall, and error distribution.

## 📖 Overview

Evaluating a classifier is often more complex than simply checking "how many did we get right." Real-world data is imbalanced, and the cost of a False Positive often differs from a False Negative.

**Classification Metrics** simplifies this evaluation process. It offers a suite of tools to analyze model behavior, visualize performance, and generate reports suitable for both data scientists and stakeholders.

### Key Capabilities

*   **Comprehensive Analysis:** Calculate standard metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) alongside advanced probabilistic metrics (ROC-AUC, Log Loss).
*   **Imbalance Handling:** Built-in support for Micro, Macro, and Weighted averaging to handle multi-class and imbalanced datasets effectively.
*   **Visualizations:** Generate confusion matrices, Precision-Recall curves, and ROC curves to identify exactly where your model is failing.
*   **Threshold Optimization:** Tools to determine the optimal decision threshold for your specific business needs.

## 🚀 Why Use This?

### 1. Go Beyond Accuracy
Accuracy can be misleading in skewed datasets. This toolkit highlights metrics that matter, ensuring your model performs well on minority classes.

### 2. Model Comparison
Easily compare multiple model iterations side-by-side. Determine if that new neural network actually outperforms your logistic regression baseline.

### 3. Explainability
Translate model performance into human-readable reports. Explain trade-offs between Precision and Recall to non-technical project managers.

## 💡 Use Cases

*   **Binary Classification:** Evaluating spam filters, medical diagnosis, or fraud detection.
*   **Multi-Class Classification:** Assessing image recognition or text sentiment analysis with multiple categories.
*   **MLOps Monitoring:** Integrating evaluation checkpoints into continuous training pipelines.
