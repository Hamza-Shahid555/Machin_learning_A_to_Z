Ordinal encoding is a machine learning technique for transforming categorical data with a natural order (like "small", "medium", "large") into numerical values by assigning a unique integer to each category based on its rank. This preserves the order of the data, which is crucial for machine learning algorithms that require numerical inputs but cannot process text. For example, "high school", "bachelor's", "master's", and "PhD" can be encoded as 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
