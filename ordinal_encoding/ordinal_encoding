Ordinal Encoding

Ordinal encoding is a technique used in machine learning preprocessing to convert categorical data (non-numeric) into numeric values, but in a way that preserves the order (rank) of the categories.

🔑 Key Points

Used when categorical features have a natural ordering.

Each category is assigned an integer value based on its order.

Example: Education level, size, ratings, etc.

✅ Example

Suppose you have a feature called Education Level:

Education Level	Ordinal Encoding
Primary	1
Secondary	2
Bachelor	3
Master	4
PhD	5

Here, the order Primary < Secondary < Bachelor < Master < PhD is preserved.

🧠 Why Use It?

Algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost, Logistic Regression need numeric input.

It makes sense when the categories have rank or hierarchy.

⚠️ When Not to Use

If categories don’t have order (e.g., colors: red, blue, green), then ordinal encoding introduces fake order, which may confuse models.

In such cases, use One-Hot Encoding instead.
