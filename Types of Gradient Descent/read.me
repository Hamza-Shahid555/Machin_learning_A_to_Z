# Types of Gradient Descent

This folder contains explanations and implementations of the **different types of Gradient Descent**, which are optimization methods used to train machine learning models.

## 📌 What Is Gradient Descent?

Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to **minimize a loss (cost) function** by updating model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## 📊 Types of Gradient Descent

There are **three common variants**:

### ✅ Batch Gradient Descent
Uses the **entire training dataset** to compute the gradient and update parameters once per epoch.  
✔ Stable but slower on large datasets. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### ✅ Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Updates parameters **after each training example**.  
✔ Faster and can escape local minima, but updates are noisy. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### ✅ Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
Splits the dataset into **small batches**, updating parameters after each batch.  
✔ Combines stability and speed, and is commonly used in practice. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
