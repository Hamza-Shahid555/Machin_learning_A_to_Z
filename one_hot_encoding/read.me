One-hot encoding is a process that transforms categorical data (text labels) into a numerical format for machine learning models by creating new binary columns for each unique category, where a single column contains a '1' for that category's presence and '0's for its absence. This process, also known as dummy variable creation, ensures that algorithms receive numerical input and avoids artificial ordering that might arise from assigning integer labels to categories.
